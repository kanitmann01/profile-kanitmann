                On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. Of the
                estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest peacetime
                maritime disasters in history.

                But here's what makes the Titanic more than just a tragic story: the passenger manifest and survival
                records provide a stark data-driven view of how social class, gender, and age determined who lived and who
                died. This wasn't just about being in the right place at the right time, it was about who you were, not
                what you did.

              I trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival based on passenger characteristics including age,
              gender, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, ticket fare, and port of
              embarkation. After tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, the model reached strong predictive accuracy
              and provided clear insights into which factors most influenced survival chances.

                Because in every crisis, from natural disasters to economic downturns to global pandemics, we see the same
                patterns emerge. Those with more resources, better access to information, and higher social status
                consistently have better outcomes. The Titanic wasn't unique in this regard; it was just unusually
                well-documented.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When we build predictive models today, whether for loan approvals, hiring decisions, or resource
                allocation, we're essentially creating modern versions of the Titanic's passenger manifest. The question
                isn't whether these systems will reflect existing inequalities; it's whether we'll acknowledge that they
                do and work to address it.

                The data science lesson here isn't just about feature importance or model accuracy. It's about
                understanding that our algorithms don't just predict the future, they can perpetuate the past. Every time
                we deploy a model, we should ask ourselves: are we building lifeboats for everyone, or just determining
                which "class" our systems are really designed for?
