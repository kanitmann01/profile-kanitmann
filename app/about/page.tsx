                  My journey into data science began with a foundation in building tangible things, from engineering
                  firmware for 3D printers to developing full-stack web applications. This hands-on experience taught me
                  that the best solutions come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human needs.

                  My time at Ericsson as an Engineer, Cloud and Infra, where my team managed the migration of over 2,000 servers to GCP,
                  taught me how to work with complex, large-scale systems. I learned that successful technology
                  implementations require not just technical expertise, but also careful planning, stakeholder
                  communication, and a deep understanding of business requirements.

                  Now, I'm a Master's student at the University of Arizona (GPA: 4.0/4.0), where I'm combining my
                  engineering background with a passion for data to build intelligent solutions. I believe the future
                  belongs to those who can bridge the gap between complex algorithms and practical applications that
                  solve real-world problems.
